    <title>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</title>
    <h3>Programming Paradigm</h3>
    <p>A programming paradigm is an approach to solve problems using some programming languages which are available to us. Some of the programming paradigms are:

        <ul>
            <li>Procedural paradigm</li>
            <li>Structutal paradigm</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented paradigm</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Procedural Paradigm</li>
        <p>It can be defined as a programming model which is derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of calling procedure. It aims in improving the clarity, quality, and development time of computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else). Example : Pascal, ALGOL, C.</p>
        <li>Structural Paradigm</li>
        <p>Here the user can create its own user-defined functions. It tries to resolve issues that are associated with unconditional transfers in order to  maintain more discipline at the design and logical structuring stage.
      Example : Pascal, ALGOL, C, Modula-2, etc. </p>
        <li>Object-Oriented Paradigm</li>
        <p>In this paradigm, programs are written as a collection of class and objects. It gives more emphasis on data rather than the procedure. Many languages designed from the 1980s to the present are object-oriented, some of them are C++, Ada 95, Java, C#. </p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Concept and Features of Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <h3>Concept of OOP</h3>
    <p>The fundamental idea behind object-oriented programming is to combine data and function into a single unit, such unit is called an object. </p>
    <h4>Concept of OOP:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Problems are divided into objects.</li>
        <li>It is not possible to access data freely.</li>
        <li>Data hiding is possible.</li>
        <li>It uses bottom-up programming technique.</li>
        <li>Data and functions are encapsulated into a single entity.</li>
        <li>In OOP, we create classes, which have the power of reusability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Object</h3>
    <p>An object is a self-contained component that consists of methods and properties to make data useful. It helps you to determine the behaviour of the class.<br/> For example, when you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.
        <br/>From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable, or a function that has a memory location..</p>

    <h3>Class</h3>
    <p>A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what will it contain. In other words, it is a blueprint to build a specific type of object that provides initial value for member variables and member functions or methods.</p>
    
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>Inheritance is one of the most important aspects of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The key to understanding Inheritance is that it provides code re-usability. In place of writing the same code, again and again, we can simply inherit the properties of one class into the other.</p>

    <h3>Types of Inheritance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Single Inheritance</li>
        <p>If a child class is built from only one parent class, then this type of inheritance is single inheritance</p>
        <li>Multi Inheritance</li>
        <p>If a child class is built from two or more classes, then this type of inheritance is multi inheritance</p>
        <li>Hierarchical Inheritance</li>
        <p>Under this type of inheritance, the behavior of one class may be derived by more than one class</p>
        <li>Multiple Inheritance</li>
        <p>Under this type of inheritance, the mechanism of deriving a class from another derived class</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>It is the process that allows the selective hiding of data and functions in a class. Encapsulation ensures that only authorized functions access the relevant data thereby maintaining against unauthorized access to ensure data safety.</p>

    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
    <p>It enables the same function to behave differently in a different class. It is the concept that supports the capability of an object of a class to behave differently in response to a message or action. </p>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p>Data abstraction is the process of identifying properties and methods related to a particular entity as relevant to the application. So, it is the process of examining all the available information about an entity to identify information that is relevant to the application. For example,
        in a "switch-board", you only press certain switches according to your requirement. What is happening inside, how it is happening, you needn't know. This is an abstraction.  </p>

    <h3>Advantages of OOP</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The complexity of the software can be merged easily</li>
        <li>Software maintenance cost can be reduced</li>
        <li>Data access is restricted providing better data security</li>
        <li>Software can be developed meeting the requirements on time, on the estimated budget.</li>
        <li>Data abstraction is possible</li>
        <li>The inheritance concpet can be used to eliminate the redundant code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantges of OOP</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use of OOP is a waste of time in case of small projects ot code</li>
        <li>OOP are much larger than other program</li>
        <li>OOP requires a lot of time to create.</li>
        <li>OOP are slower than other programs, partially because of their size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applications of OOP</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented database systems</li>
        <li>Image processing</li>
        <li>Pattern recognition</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Computer aided teaching</li>
        <li>Computer games</li>
        <li>Internet-based applications</li>
        <li>Data warehouse and data mining</li>
        <li>Paralled computing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Difference Between OOP and Structured Programming languages</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Structured programming  divides the code into modules or function, while OOP is based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields known as attributes, and code in the form of procedures known as methods.</li>
</ul>
