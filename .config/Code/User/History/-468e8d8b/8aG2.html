    <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics</h3>
    <p>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. AI is generally associated with computer science, but it has many important links with other fields such as maths, psychology, linguistics, cognition, biology, neuroscience, etc. AI is the study of how to make computers do things that, at the moment, people do better. </p>

    <p>Applications of AI</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Healthcare Industry</li>
        <p>AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and idfferent treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures.</p>

        <li>Autonomous driving</li>
        <p>Machines must weigh the consequences of any action as each action will impact the result. For autonomous cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents collisions.</p>

        <li>Playing game</li>
        <p>General game playing (GGP) and General video game playing (GVGP)is the concept and designs of AI. For instance, in the GGP of chess, computers are programmed to play these games using a specially designed algorithm. It is considered a necessary landmark on the way to AI.</p>

        <li>Computer vision</li>
        <p>It is a file of AI, which enables the computer and its systems to get input in the form of digital images and videos and take action based on the provided input.</p>

        <li>Finance industry</li>
        <p>AI is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits which help a bank's fraud department.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Robotics</h3>
    <p>It is a branch of engineering, that invloves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots which overlaps with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics and bioengineering. Sir Isaax Asimov is often given credit for being the first person to use the term robotics who composed three principles in the 1940s about the behavior of robots. Those are; 
    <ol>
        <li>Robots must never harm human beings</li>
        <li>Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1</li>
        <li>Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.</li>
    </ol>    
    </p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
    <p>CLoud computing uses various services, such as software development platforms, servers, storage, and software over the Internet, often referred to as a cloud. </p>

    <p>Types of Cloud</p>
    <p>Clouds can be classified as public, private, and hybrid. <br/> Public cloud is made available to the general public.<br/> Private cloud computing 
    environment resides within the boundaries of an organization and is used exclusively for organizational benefits. <br/> Hybrid cloud is the combination of
    both public and private cloud. </p>


    <h3>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cost</li>
        <p>It is probably the most efficient method to use, maintain and upgrade.</p>

        <p>Storing information in the cloud gives us almost unlimited storage capacity</p>
        <li>Backup and recovery</li>
        <p>Since, all the data is stored in the cloud, backing it up and restoring is relatively much easier than storing on a physical device</p>
        <li>Quick deployment</li>
        <p>Once the method of functioning is selected, the entire system can be fully functional in a matter of few minutes</p>
        <li>Security</li>
        <p>Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen the overall security, helping protect your data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats.</p>
    </ol>

        <p>Any data which can be stored, accessed and processed in the form of fixed format is termed as a structured data.</p>
        <li>Unstructured</li>
        <p>Any data with unknown form or the structure is classified as unstructured data. This makes it very difficult and time-consuming to process and analyse teh unstructured data.</p>
        <li>Semi-structured</li>
        <p>This data contain both the forms of data. We can see semi-structured data as a structured in form but it is actually not defined with e.g., a table definition in relational DBMS. Example: XML file.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Characteristics of Big Data</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Variety</li>
        <p>It refers to the variety of data gathered from multiple sources. </p>
        <li>Velocity</li>
        <p>It refers to the speed at which data is being created in real-time. It also comprises the rate of change, linking of incoming data sets at varying speeds, and activity bursts.</p>

        <li>Volume</li>
        <p>Big Data indicates huge 'volumes' of data that are being generated daily from various sources like social media platforms, business processes, machines, networks, human interactions, etc.</p>
        <li>Veracity</li>
        <p>It refers to the reliability or trustworthiness of the data. Due to the large volume of data, we have uncertainity about the validity, the accurateness of data.</p>

        <li>Value</li>
        <p>It refers to the worth of business value of the collected data</p>

        <li>Variability</li>
        <p>It refers to the inconsistency of big data and how the big data can be used and formatted.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
    <p>Virtual reality (VR) is a term that expresses computer-based simulated environments that can perceive as the real world and the unreal world. It is a computer-simulated or artificial environment created with software and presented to the user so that the user believes and accepts it as a real environment.
    </p>

    <h4>Appplications of VR</h4>
